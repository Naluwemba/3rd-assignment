 # 90%-100% Grade is A
 # 80%-89% Grade is B
 #70%-79%  Grade is C
 # 60%-69% Grade is D
 #50%-59% Grade IS E
 #< 50% Fail

# Witi Academy is proposing a sacco to help students save their money.
# Design a platform that will do the following .
# Welcome to ,Witi academy sacco.
# 1.Deposit money
# 2.withdraw money
# 3.check balance
# Ensure if the students selects 1,money is deposited and the minimum deposit should be 1000
# If the students selects 2, money should be withdrawn and the minimum withdrawal is 500
# If the students selects 3, the account balance should be displayed

# answers 4
# accountBalance = 0
# run = 1
# while run ==1:
#       print('1.Deposit money')
#       print('2.Withdraw money')
#       print('3.Check balance')
# studentchoice = int(input('Enter your selection(1,2,or 3)'))
